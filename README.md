# House_Prices

Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. 
But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.
